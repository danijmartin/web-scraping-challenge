# Mission to Mars  

This repository uses the Python Splinter and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape 4 separate websites to pull various information about the planet Mars.  

### These Websites Include:  
* [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/)  
* [Mars Space Images](https://spaceimages-mars.com/)  
* [Mars Facts](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/)  
* [Mars Hemispheres](https://marshemispheres.com/)  

### Steps Included:
1. Jupyter Notebook titled mission_to_mars.ipynb was initially used to build the code and ensure the correct items were scraped from each website.  
2. This code was then converted into the scrape_mars.py file.  
3. An app.py file was then created to read the scrape_mars.py file and render an HTML template.  
4. To bring everything together, the template index.html contains the bulk of the styling for the final rendered html page.  

#### To see the final result, check out the Images folder for a screen shot of the final application.
